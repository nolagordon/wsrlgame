Plan to implement enemy merging:

Update listeners for entity Mixins

Either recycle the melee attacker mixin or create a new mixin for enemies
Add/update the bumpEntity listener to trigger some event that may cause
  the enemies to merge if they are of compatible types
    - ex: vanilla and chocolate, vanilla-chocolate swirl and strawberry, etc.
Options for changing enemy stats:
  - add the stats of the two enemies that merged
  - average the stats of the enemies that merged
  - other math?
Notify the player through a message that enemies have merged (so they
  know there's a stronger-than-average enemy out there)
