Plan to implement enemy merging:

Update listeners for entity Mixins

Either recycle the melee attacker mixin or create a new mixin for enemies
Add/update the bumpEntity listener to trigger some event that may cause
  the enemies to merge if they are of compatible types
    - ex: vanilla and chocolate, vanilla-chocolate swirl and strawberry, etc.
Options for changing enemy stats:
  - add the stats of the two enemies that merged
  - average the stats of the enemies that merged
  - other math?
Notify the player through a message that enemies have merged (so they
  know there's a stronger-than-average enemy out there)

New thoughts about how to accomplish the merging - Add to the act function of
 WanderActor to look for compatible monsters in adjacent squares before moving.
Also, have a list of compatible merging types as part of the entity information.
Right now I have a listener for merging monsters, but it might be easier to use
that to just get rid of the other monster and do the actual entity change with
the entity that is trying to move.
