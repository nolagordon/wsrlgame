Notes about multiple floors:
  Right now, my idea is to add stairs to each floor in some random location, then generate a new
floor each time the player ascends/descends stairs. The player will be placed in a random location
after changing floors. There should be some extra field that will store the floor that the player is
on. Enemies can be generated based on which floor the player occupies. The player can press enter
to interact with a staircase.
  Current bugs: sometimes it seems that the stairs generates in an unreachable position. I'm not sure
whether this can be fixed by using another map generation algorithm. Also for some reason the FoV stuff
shuts off whenever the avatar walks onto the staircase.
