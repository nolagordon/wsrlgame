Notes about multiple floors:
  Right now, my idea is to add stairs to each floor in some random location, then generate a new
floor each time the player ascends/descends stairs. The player will be placed in a random location
after changing floors. There should be some extra field that will store the floor that the player is
on. Enemies can be generated based on which floor the player occupies. The player can press enter
to interact with a staircase.
  Current bugs: sometimes it seems that the stairs generates in an unreachable position. I'm not sure
whether this can be fixed by using another map generation algorithm. Also for some reason the FoV stuff
shuts off whenever the avatar walks onto the staircase.

Right now, we support multiple floor levels, but there's a chance that the player may get stuck
on a level with no reachable staircase. The player wins the game when they reach floor one.
the player can only descend stairs, and can't ascend stairs.

CONCERN: Do we need to delete the entities on the map before we switch floors? Will there be any adverse
affects on our game if we don't?
