Frozen: The Game

Game Summary
  You work part-time in an ice cream factory. One day during your shift, the nearby
nuclear plant explodes, and the resulting radiation turns you into a snowflake
and the ice cream into living, breathing monsters. Unfortunately, you work on the
top floor, and you must reach the exit on the ground level to escape (and hopefully
get to a hospital to cure your radiation-related diseases).
  To win the game, you need to escape from the factory. You lose if your HP ever
hits 0. When playing the game, you move around the factory and run into enemies
to kill them.

Inspiration
  Our main inspiration is from ADOM. We found it really fun how eating different
monster corpses had different effects, so we want to implement a similar (somewhat
less gruesome) feature where the main player is allergic to different things
and may experience allergic reactions when eating certain ice cream flavors.
